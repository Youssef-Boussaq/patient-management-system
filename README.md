The demo project
This guide covers building a simple patient management system for a veterinary practice using Filament. It will support adding new patients (cats, dogs, or rabbits), assigning them to an owner, and recording which treatments they received. The system will have a dashboard with statistics about the types of patients and a chart showing the number of treatments administered over the past year.
